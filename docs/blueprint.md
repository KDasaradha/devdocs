# **App Name**: DevDocs++

## Core Features:

- Markdown Rendering: Display documentation content from Markdown files in a user-friendly format. The application should automatically generate a single-page website from the markdown files.
- Theme Switching: Enable users to switch between different themes (light and dark) for optimal viewing experience.
- Documentation Search: Implement a search functionality that allows users to quickly find specific information within the documentation using keywords.

## Style Guidelines:

- Use a monochrome color scheme with shades of gray for the background and text to ensure a clean and professional look.
- Implement a dark theme option with a dark background and light text for improved readability in low-light environments.
- Accent color: Use a muted teal (#4DB6AC) to highlight interactive elements and code blocks.
- Use a two-column layout with a fixed-width sidebar for navigation and a larger main content area for documentation.
- Employ simple, outline-style icons for navigation and common actions to maintain a minimalist design.
