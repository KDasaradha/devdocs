# Next.js - Basic Concepts

Key topics for basic Next.js include:

- Introduction to Next.js: What it is, key features (SSR, SSG, routing, API routes)
- Project Setup: `create-next-app`
- Pages Router vs. App Router (basic understanding of both)
- **App Router Basics (Preferred):**
    - File-system routing: `app` directory, `page.tsx` (or `.js`)
    - Layouts (`layout.tsx`) and Nested Layouts
    - Server Components and Client Components (`"use client"`)
    - Linking and Navigation (`<Link>` component, `useRouter` hook from `next/navigation`)
- Basic Data Fetching in Server Components (using `async/await` directly)
- Static Assets: `public` folder
- CSS Styling: Global CSS, CSS Modules
- API Routes (App Router: Route Handlers in `route.ts`)
- Running the development server and building for production
