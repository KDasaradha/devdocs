#### Threat Modeling (OWASP Threat Dragon, Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool)
##### What is Threat Modeling?
- **Definition**: A structured process to identify, prioritize, and mitigate potential security threats to a system or application during design and development.
- **Purpose**: Shifts security left by proactively addressing risks before they become exploitable vulnerabilities.
- **Key Steps**:
  1. Define the system (e.g., architecture, data flows).
  2. Identify threats.
  3. Assess risks.
  4. Plan mitigations.

##### OWASP Threat Dragon
- **Overview**: An open-source, web-based threat modeling tool maintained by OWASP, designed for ease of use and collaboration.
- **Features**:
  - Drag-and-drop interface for creating data flow diagrams (DFDs).
  - Built-in threat generation based on STRIDE.
  - Exportable reports (e.g., JSON, PDF).
- **Setup**:
  1. Install: Run locally (`npm install -g threat-dragon`) or use the web version (`https://threatdragon.org`).
  2. Create a model:
     - Add components (e.g., web app, database).
     - Draw data flows (e.g., HTTP requests).
     - Generate threats automatically.
- **Example**:
  - **System**: Web app â†’ API â†’ Database.
  - **Threat Generated**: "Spoofing: An attacker could impersonate the API."
  - **Mitigation**: "Implement mutual TLS authentication."
- **DevSecOps Use**:
  - Integrate with CI/CD by storing models in Git:
    ```bash
    git add threat-model.json
    ```
  - Review threats during sprint planning.

##### Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool (TMT)
- **Overview**: A free desktop tool from Microsoft for creating threat models, widely used in enterprise settings.
- **Features**:
  - Template-driven (e.g., web apps, Azure).
  - STRIDE-based threat analysis.
  - Detailed reporting with mitigation suggestions.
- **Setup**:
  1. Download: Available from Microsoftâ€™s website.
  2. Create a model:
     - Draw a DFD (e.g., client â†’ server â†’ storage).
     - Analyze threats via the toolâ€™s engine.
     - Export findings as HTML/PDF.
- **Example**:
  - **System**: Client â†’ Azure Function â†’ Blob Storage.
  - **Threat**: "Tampering: Data in transit could be altered."
  - **Mitigation**: "Enforce HTTPS with TLS 1.3."
- **DevSecOps Use**:
  - Automate analysis with CLI:
    ```bash
    tmtool.exe -i model.tm7 -o report.html
    ```
  - Embed in design reviews for cloud-native apps.

##### Best Practices
- Model early in the SDLC (design phase).
- Update models with system changes (e.g., new APIs).
- Collaborate with developers, architects, and security teams.

#### Security Risk Assessments (STRIDE, DREAD, CVSS)
##### What is a Security Risk Assessment?
- **Definition**: A systematic evaluation of potential security risks, their likelihood, and impact to prioritize mitigation efforts.
- **Purpose**: Quantifies threats to guide resource allocation and response.

##### STRIDE
- **Overview**: A threat classification framework developed by Microsoft to identify threats across six categories.
- **Categories**:
  1. **Spoofing**: Impersonating a user or system.
     - Example: Fake login page stealing credentials.
     - Mitigation: MFA, client certificates.
  2. **Tampering**: Altering data or code.
     - Example: Modifying a database query in transit.
     - Mitigation: Integrity checks (e.g., SHA-256 hashes).
  3. **Repudiation**: Denying an action occurred.
     - Example: User denies placing an order.
     - Mitigation: Audit logs with timestamps.
  4. **Information Disclosure**: Exposing sensitive data.
     - Example: Unencrypted API response leaking PII.
     - Mitigation: Encryption (e.g., AES-256).
  5. **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Disrupting availability.
     - Example: Flooding a server with requests.
     - Mitigation: Rate limiting, DDoS protection (e.g., AWS Shield).
  6. **Elevation of Privilege**: Gaining unauthorized access.
     - Example: Exploiting a bug to become root.
     - Mitigation: Least privilege, RBAC.
- **Example Application**:
  - **System**: Web app with user login.
  - **STRIDE Analysis**:
    - Spoofing: Weak passwords â†’ Require MFA.
    - DoS: No rate limits â†’ Add API throttling.
- **DevSecOps Use**: Align STRIDE with CI/CD checks (e.g., scan for weak auth).

##### DREAD
- **Overview**: A risk assessment model to score threats based on five criteria (Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, Discoverability).
- **Scoring (0-10)**:
  - **Damage**: How much harm if exploited? (e.g., 10 = data loss).
  - **Reproducibility**: How easy to repeat? (e.g., 10 = always works).
  - **Exploitability**: How hard to exploit? (e.g., 5 = needs skill).
  - **Affected Users**: Scope of impact? (e.g., 8 = all users).
  - **Discoverability**: How easy to find? (e.g., 7 = public vuln).
- **Example**:
  - **Threat**: SQL Injection.
  - **DREAD Score**: D:9, R:8, E:6, A:10, D:7 â†’ Total: 40/50 (High risk).
  - **Mitigation**: Use parameterized queries.
- **DevSecOps Use**: Prioritize fixes in sprint planning based on DREAD scores.

##### CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)
- **Overview**: An industry-standard framework to quantify the severity of vulnerabilities (v3.1 widely used).
- **Components**:
  - **Base Score**: Intrinsic qualities (e.g., Exploitability, Impact).
  - **Temporal Score**: Time-based factors (e.g., patch availability).
  - **Environmental Score**: Organization-specific impact.
- **Scoring (0-10)**:
  - **Metrics**: Attack Vector (Network, Local), Complexity, Privileges Required, Confidentiality Impact, etc.
  - **Example**: CVE-2023-1234 (RCE vuln).
    - Vector: Network, Complexity: Low, Impact: High â†’ Score: 9.8 (Critical).
- **Calculation**: Use NVD calculator (`https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator`).
- **DevSecOps Use**:
  - Integrate CVSS into vulnerability scanners (e.g., Trivy):
    ```bash
    trivy image my-app:latest --severity CRITICAL,HIGH
    ```
  - Fail CI/CD on scores above 7.0.

#### Implementing Security Frameworks (NIST, ISO 27001)
##### NIST (800-53)
- **Overview**: A U.S. framework (Special Publication 800-53) for securing federal systems, widely adopted in private sectors for its comprehensive controls.
- **Key Controls**:
  - **Access Control (AC)**: Restrict access (e.g., RBAC).
  - **Audit and Accountability (AU)**: Log all actions (e.g., CloudTrail).
  - **System and Communications Protection (SC)**: Encrypt data (e.g., TLS).
- **Implementation**:
  1. **Categorize**: Assess system risk (e.g., FIPS 199).
  2. **Select Controls**: Map to NIST 800-53 (e.g., AC-3 for access enforcement).
  3. **Implement**: Use IaC:
     ```hcl
     # Terraform: Enforce encryption
     resource "aws_s3_bucket" "secure" {
       bucket = "my-secure-bucket"
       server_side_encryption_configuration {
         rule {
           apply_server_side_encryption_by_default {
             sse_algorithm = "AES256"
           }
         }
       }
     }
     ```
  4. **Monitor**: Use AWS Security Hub for compliance checks.
- **DevSecOps Use**:
  - Automate controls with CI/CD (e.g., fail builds if encryption is missing).
  - Map MITRE ATT&CK to NIST controls for threat coverage.

##### ISO 27001
- **Overview**: An international standard for establishing an Information Security Management System (ISMS).
- **Key Components**:
  - **Clause 4-10**: Context, leadership, planning, operation, evaluation.
  - **Annex A**: 114 controls (e.g., A.12.4.1 - Event Logging).
- **Implementation**:
  1. **Scope**: Define ISMS boundaries (e.g., cloud app).
  2. **Risk Assessment**: Use STRIDE/DREAD to identify risks.
  3. **Controls**: Implement Annex A:
     - A.9.1.2 (Access Control): Use Kubernetes RBAC:
       ```yaml
       apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
       kind: Role
       metadata:
         name: app-access
       rules:
       - apiGroups: [""]
         resources: ["pods"]
         verbs: ["get"]
       ```
  4. **Audit**: Conduct internal audits and prepare for certification.
- **DevSecOps Use**:
  - Automate logging with ELK:
    ```yaml
    # GitLab CI
    log_to_elk:
      script:
        - logstash -f logstash.conf
    ```
  - Enforce policies with OPA.

##### Comparison
| **Framework** | **Scope**            | **Focus**               |
|---------------|----------------------|-------------------------|
| **NIST 800-53**| Technical controls   | U.S. compliance         |
| **ISO 27001** | Management system    | Global certification    |
