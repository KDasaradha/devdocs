#### Git & GitHub/GitLab
##### What is Git?
- **Definition**: Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that tracks changes in source code, enabling collaboration among multiple developers.
- **Core Concepts**:
  - **Repository**: A storage location for code and its history (local or remote).
  - **Commit**: A snapshot of changes with a unique hash (e.g., `a1b2c3d4`).
  - **Branch**: A parallel version of the codebase (e.g., `feature/new-login`).
  - **Merge**: Combining changes from one branch into another (e.g., merging `feature` into `main`).
  - **Clone**: Copying a remote repository to a local machine.
- **Key Commands**:
  - `git init`: Initialize a new repository.
  - `git add .`: Stage all changes.
  - `git commit -m "message"`: Save changes locally.
  - `git push origin main`: Upload changes to a remote repository.
  - `git pull`: Fetch and merge updates from remote.
- **Distributed Nature**: Every developer has a full copy of the repository, enabling offline work and resilience.

##### GitHub vs GitLab
- **GitHub**:
  - A cloud-hosted platform for Git repositories, owned by Microsoft.
  - **Features**:
    - Public/private repositories.
    - GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation.
    - Pull Requests (PRs) for code review.
  - **DevSecOps Use**: Integrate security scans (e.g., Dependabot for dependency checks) into workflows.
- **GitLab**:
  - An open-source, self-hosted or cloud-based alternative to GitHub.
  - **Features**:
    - Built-in CI/CD pipelines (`.gitlab-ci.yml`).
    - Advanced security features (e.g., SAST, DAST out of the box).
    - Issue tracking and wikis.
  - **DevSecOps Use**: Comprehensive security tools integrated natively (e.g., container scanning).
- **Comparison**:
  | **Aspect**         | **GitHub**                  | **GitLab**                  |
  |--------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
  | **CI/CD**          | GitHub Actions             | Native GitLab CI/CD         |
  | **Security Tools** | Add-ons (e.g., CodeQL)     | Built-in (e.g., SAST)       |
  | **Hosting**        | Cloud-first, limited self  | Cloud or self-hosted        |
- **Choosing**: GitHub for simplicity and community; GitLab for end-to-end DevSecOps.

##### Practical Workflow
- **Example**:
  1. Clone a repo: `git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git`.
  2. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/security-fix`.
  3. Make changes and commit: `git commit -m "Add input validation"`.
  4. Push to remote: `git push origin feature/security-fix`.
  5. Open a PR (GitHub) or MR (GitLab) for review.
- **DevSecOps Integration**: Add automated security checks (e.g., linting, vulnerability scanning) before merging.

#### Secure Git Practices
##### GPG Signing
- **What is GPG Signing?**: Adding a cryptographic signature to Git commits and tags to verify their authenticity and integrity.
- **Why Use It?**:
  - Prevents impersonation (e.g., someone forging a commit as you).
  - Ensures code hasnâ€™t been tampered with.
- **Setup**:
  1. **Install GPG**: On Linux (`sudo apt install gnupg`), macOS (`brew install gnupg`), or Windows (Gpg4win).
  2. **Generate a Key**: `gpg --gen-key` (follow prompts to create a key pair).
  3. **List Keys**: `gpg --list-keys` (note the key ID, e.g., `A1B2C3D4`).
  4. **Configure Git**: `git config --global user.signingkey A1B2C3D4`.
  5. **Enable Signing**: `git config --global commit.gpgsign true`.
- **Signing Commits**:
  - Manual: `git commit -S -m "Signed commit"`.
  - Automatic: Enabled via the config above.
- **Verification**:
  - On GitHub/GitLab: Signed commits show a "Verified" badge.
  - Manually: `git log --show-signature` to check signatures.
- **DevSecOps Benefit**: Ensures trust in the software supply chain by validating commit authorship.

##### Branch Protection
- **Definition**: Rules to safeguard critical branches (e.g., `main`, `develop`) from unauthorized or risky changes.
- **Why It Matters**: Prevents accidental overwrites, untested code, or malicious pushes in a collaborative environment.
- **Implementation**:
  - **GitHub**:
    1. Go to repo > Settings > Branches > Branch protection rules.
    2. Add rule for `main`:
       - Require pull request reviews before merging.
       - Require status checks (e.g., CI builds, security scans) to pass.
       - Prevent force pushes (`git push --force`).
       - Restrict who can push (e.g., admins only).
  - **GitLab**:
    1. Go to Settings > Repository > Protected Branches.
    2. Protect `main`:
       - Allow merges only via Merge Requests (MRs).
       - Require code review approvals.
       - Block direct pushes.
- **Best Practices**:
  - Use branch naming conventions (e.g., `feature/`, `bugfix/`) for organization.
  - Enforce linear history with rebase or squash merges to avoid messy merges.
- **DevSecOps Angle**: Ensures only secure, reviewed code reaches production branches.

##### Code Reviews
- **Definition**: A collaborative process where peers review code changes before theyâ€™re merged into the main codebase.
- **Goals**:
  - Catch bugs and security flaws early.
  - Improve code quality and maintainability.
  - Share knowledge across the team.
- **Process**:
  1. **Create a PR/MR**: Push a branch and open a Pull Request (GitHub) or Merge Request (GitLab).
  2. **Review**: Team members check for:
     - **Security**: SQL injection risks, hardcoded secrets.
     - **Style**: Adherence to coding standards (e.g., PEP 8 for Python).
     - **Functionality**: Does it work as intended?
  3. **Feedback**: Comments, suggestions, or requests for changes.
  4. **Approval**: Merge once approved and tests pass.
- **Secure Code Review Checklist**:
  - Are inputs validated and sanitized?
  - Are dependencies safe and up-to-date?
  - Are secrets (e.g., API keys) exposed?
  - Are error messages safe (no sensitive data leaks)?
- **Tools**:
  - GitHub/GitLab built-in review features.
  - Add-ons: CodeQL (GitHub) for automated security analysis.
- **DevSecOps Integration**:
  - Automate parts of the review with static analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube).
  - Require security scans (e.g., SAST) as a PR/MR prerequisite.

#### Practical Example: Secure Git Workflow
1. **Setup**:
   - Configure GPG signing: `git config --global commit.gpgsign true`.
   - Protect `main` branch on GitHub/GitLab with PR/MR requirements.
2. **Development**:
   - Clone repo: `git clone <repo-url>`.
   - Create branch: `git checkout -b feature/add-auth`.
   - Code changes and commit: `git commit -S -m "Add OAuth2 authentication"`.
   - Push: `git push origin feature/add-auth`.
3. **Review**:
   - Open a PR/MR.
   - Team reviews for security (e.g., OAuth implementation) and approves.
   - CI pipeline runs security scans (e.g., Trivy, Dependabot).
4. **Merge**:
   - Merge into `main` after approval and passing checks.
   - Signed commit appears as "Verified" on GitHub/GitLab.

### Additional Considerations
#### Git Security Threats
- **Credential Exposure**: Accidentally committing secrets (e.g., `.env` files).
  - **Mitigation**: Use `.gitignore`, scan with tools like `git-secrets` or `truffleHog`.
- **Unsigned Commits**: Allowing unverified changes.
  - **Mitigation**: Enforce GPG signing in team policies.
- **Branch Overwrites**: Force pushes erasing history.
  - **Mitigation**: Enable branch protection.

#### Scaling Git for Teams
- **Git Flow**: A branching strategy with `main`, `develop`, `feature/`, `release/`, and `hotfix/` branches.
- **Trunk-Based Development**: Simpler approach with short-lived branches into `main`.
- **DevSecOps Fit**: Choose based on team size and security needs (e.g., Git Flow for stricter control).
