Got it! Since you're new to **AWS Cloud**, let’s start with the **basics in a structured way** so you can learn step by step without feeling overwhelmed.  

---

## **🎯 Beginner-Friendly AWS Learning Path**

### **🔹 Step 1: Understand What Cloud Computing Is**
Before jumping into AWS, understand **what cloud computing is** and why companies use it:  
✔️ Cloud = Renting servers instead of buying them.  
✔️ AWS provides servers, storage, databases, and networking **on demand**.  
✔️ No need to maintain physical servers—AWS takes care of it.  

---

## **🔹 Step 2: AWS Free Account Setup**
🛠️ **[Sign Up for AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)** (Requires a credit/debit card, but AWS provides free services for a year).  
🔹 Free Tier gives you:
- **EC2 (Virtual Machine)**
- **S3 (Storage)**
- **RDS (Database)**
- **Lambda (Serverless Computing)**  

Once signed up, log into the **AWS Management Console**.

---

## **🔹 Step 3: Learn the Core AWS Services (Beginner Level)**
Focus on these **4 fundamental AWS services** first:

### **✅ 1. Compute: EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**
EC2 = A virtual machine (server) running in AWS.  
📌 **Learn how to:**
- Launch an EC2 instance (like running a computer in the cloud).  
- Connect to it using **SSH**.  
- Start, stop, and terminate instances.  
👉 **Hands-on Task:** Create and log in to an EC2 instance.

---

S3 = Cloud storage for images, videos, backups, etc.  
📌 **Learn how to:**
- Create an **S3 bucket** (like a cloud folder).  
- Upload/download files.  
- Set permissions (private/public).  
👉 **Hands-on Task:** Upload a file to S3 and make it public.

---

### **✅ 3. Database: RDS (Relational Database Service)**
RDS = AWS-managed database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.).  
📌 **Learn how to:**
- Create an RDS database.  
- Connect it to an application.  
👉 **Hands-on Task:** Set up an **RDS MySQL database**.

---

### **✅ 4. Networking: VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**
VPC = Your own private network in AWS.  
📌 **Learn how to:**
- Understand **Security Groups** (like firewalls for EC2).  
- Set up an **Elastic IP** (a static IP for your instance).  
👉 **Hands-on Task:** Set up a VPC and assign it to EC2.

---

## **🔹 Step 4: AWS CLI (Command Line Interface)**
AWS CLI = Manage AWS services using commands instead of the console.  
📌 **Learn how to:**
- Install AWS CLI.  
- List S3 buckets using `aws s3 ls`.  
- Launch EC2 using CLI.  
👉 **Hands-on Task:** Use CLI to create and delete an S3 bucket.

---

## **🔹 Step 5: AWS Identity & Security**
🔹 **IAM (Identity and Access Management)** – Controls who can access AWS.  
📌 **Learn how to:**
- Create a new **IAM user** with limited permissions.  
- Attach **IAM roles** to EC2 for security.  
👉 **Hands-on Task:** Create a user and give them S3 read access.

---

## **🚀 Next Steps (Intermediate Level)**
Once you're comfortable with EC2, S3, RDS, and IAM, move to:  
✔️ **Auto Scaling & Load Balancer** – Scale EC2 automatically.  
✔️ **CloudFront (CDN)** – Speed up website loading.  
✔️ **AWS Lambda** – Run code without servers (serverless).  
✔️ **AWS CloudWatch** – Monitor logs and performance.

---

## **🎯 Beginner-Friendly AWS Roadmap Summary**
1️⃣ **Create an AWS Free Account**  
2️⃣ **Launch an EC2 instance** and connect via SSH.  
3️⃣ **Upload a file to S3** and manage storage.  
4️⃣ **Create an RDS database** and connect to it.  
5️⃣ **Learn IAM security** (create users and roles).  
6️⃣ **Use AWS CLI** to manage AWS via terminal.  
7️⃣ **Move to advanced topics like scaling & monitoring**.
