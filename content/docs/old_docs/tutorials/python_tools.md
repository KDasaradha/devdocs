## 1. Dependency & Package Managers
Tools to manage Python package installations and dependencies.

- **pip**  
  The default package manager for Python, used to install and manage libraries.
- **Conda**  
  A package, dependency, and environment manager supporting multiple programming languages.
- **Poetry**  
  A dependency management tool that simplifies package management and publishing.

## 3. Virtual Environments
Tools to ensure project isolation and manage dependencies efficiently.

- **pyenv**  
  Helps manage multiple Python versions on a system.
- **virtualenv**  
  Creates isolated Python environments to manage dependencies efficiently.
- **pipenv**  
  Combines `pip` and `virtualenv` for better dependency management.

---

## 4. Linters & Style Checkers
Tools to enforce coding standards and maintain code quality.

- **Pylint**  
  Checks for errors and enforces coding standards.
- **Ruff**  
  A fast Python linter and formatter.
- **Flake8**  
  Combines various linting tools into a single framework.

---

## 5. Type Checkers
Tools to ensure type correctness in Python codebases.

- **mypy**  
  A static type checker for Python.
- **Pyright**  
  A fast type checker developed by Microsoft.
- **Typeguard**  
  A runtime type checker for Python.

---

## 6. Logging
Tools to monitor application behavior and track issues.

- **Rich**  
  Provides beautiful console output with formatting, tables, and progress bars.
- **Loguru**  
  A modern logging framework for Python.
- **tqdm**  
  A simple, fast progress bar for loops.

---

## 7. Testing
Tools to automate testing for software reliability.

- **pytest**  
  A widely used testing framework for Python.
- **hypothesis**  
  A property-based testing library.
- **Robot Framework**  
  A keyword-driven testing framework.

---

## 8. Debugging
Tools to identify and fix issues in your code.

- **PDB**  
  The built-in Python debugger.
- **Icecream**  
  A debugging tool that prints variables and expressions.
- **PySnooper**  
  A lightweight debugging utility that logs function execution details.

---

## 9. Code Refactoring
Tools to improve and restructure code efficiently.

- **Jedi**  
  An autocompletion and static analysis library for Python.
- **Sourcery**  
  An AI-powered code refactoring tool.
- **Vulture**  
  Finds unused code in Python projects.

---

## 10. Code Security
Tools to detect and mitigate security vulnerabilities.

- **Bandit**  
  A security linter for identifying vulnerabilities in Python code.
- **Safety**  
  Checks Python dependencies for security vulnerabilities.
- **Detect-Secrets**  
  Scans code for hardcoded secrets.
